                      <p><a href="https://www.gds.org/" target="_blank"> &Sc;Georgetown Day School</a> Seventh grade history tackles the theme of power by considering the ways in which institutionalized systems of power can be broken down or revamped. Global revolutions and power struggles are the focal point as we begin the year discussing early modern imperialism.Students then study the Haitian Revolution, the struggle to implement fair and permanent government thereafter, and the Haitian immigrant experience of the modern day.   In the study of each region and major revolution, we contemplate the influences of geography and cultural exchanges, and attempt to identify challenges or obstacles to stabilizing post-revolutionary societies</p>

                      <p> &Sc;We will continue this practice of considering the historical colonization, revolution, and present day experience for several regions throughout the world, including Cuba, South Asia and the Middle East.We seek to stimulate curiosity and critical thinking in an active classroom. While exploring revolutions is inherently interesting, our focus centers on the process of careful historical study: thinking analytically by crafting questions and searching for evidence, and then corroborating that evidence with a number of sources. </p>

                <p> &ldquo;Looking back on the history of Haiti and its recent struggles, it is sometimes difficult not to succumb to 
                hopelessness, to the feeling that nothing can be done.But in truth, none of what has happened in Haiti during the past 200 years has been inevitable. Haiti&rsquo;s current situation is the culmination of a long set of historical choices that date back to its beginning as a French plantation colony. And it is the consequence of the ways that powerful political leaders and institutions, inside and outside the country, have ignored and suppressed the aspirations of Haiti&rsquo;s majority.&rdquo;
